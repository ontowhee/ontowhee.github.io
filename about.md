Hello, Iâ€™m Lilian, an experienced software engineer, working mainly with the Django web framework. I've worked on projects with teams at early stage startups as well as large organizations.

I am a member of the [Djangonaut Space Mentorship Program](https://djangonaut.space), where I've been involved a mentee, a mentor, a session organizer, and a Space Reviewer. I'm grateful for the mentorship I receive through this program. To give back to the community, I love helping others start their open source journey.

When I'm not building products, I enjoy cooking with friends, volunteering at local events, and training to become a radio station DJ so I can one day run my own radio show.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/ontowhee), [Fediverse](https://fosstodon.org/@ontowhee), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilian-t-669902295). I also write a weekly [newslettter](https://buttondown.com/ontowhee).

If you're interested in hiring me, please [do get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilian-t-669902295).
